                I am a software engineer based in Krak√≥w, Poland. I am working on web applications including the newest
                frameworks and libraries such as Reach, Angular, TypeScript, NodeJS.&nbsp;I&nbsp;like to learn new
                things and I am looking forward to working with great people.
            </p>
            <p className="my-4 text-lg">
                I've started coding {yearsFromStartedCoding} years ago and I'm still in love with it. In my life I've
                tried a lot of fields of programming, started from low level in assembler, through C++. I had
                opportunity to learn how develop Android Apps in Java and for iOS in Swift as well as desktop
                application in C# based on WPF. I also worked on a lot of projects in the area of web development, where
                currently I strong develop myself. Touching this many areas was possible because I attended to technical
                high school on IT profile and I graduated from AGH University of Science and Technology on Applied
                Computer Science
            </p>
            <p className="my-4 text-lg">
                Currently, the main emphasis is on web applications. In my professional life I worked commercially with
                Wordpress and then I created complex web applications based on ReactJS, TypeScript, NextJS. Recently, my
                stack was also joined by Angular 10+, some backend in NodeJS and a bit of devops in Azure DevOps.

            <p className="my-4 text-lg">
                I try to keep up to date with news from the world of web dev. I listen to podcasts such as{' '}
